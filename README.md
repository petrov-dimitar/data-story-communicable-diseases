## Description
This was an individual project, part of my "Data Science" specialization course in university. The goal of the project was to develop an interactive data story that contributes to one or more United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The topic of choice for this project was NCDs, more widely known as Chronic disease. The end deliverable for the data story was a process report and a one-page website data story with interactive visualizations and a storyline as follows:
1. Topic introduction
2. United Nations' 2030 targets
3. Problem definition
4. Types of chronic disease
5. Worldwide number of people afflicted by chronic disease over time
6. How the number of people afflicted change between 2000-2016
7. Why is the progress not fast enough
8. Recommendations to increase the progress

The realization of project required an extensive amount of data gathering, combining, cleaning and manipulation technics and the usage of various Big Data open sources.
